A priority queue controls the timeline of the subway system. When a train arrives at a station, the event is added to the priority queue. The priority queue then sorts the events by time and executes them in order. The priority queue is implemented using a heap. The heap is implemented using a list. The list is implemented using a dynamic array. The dynamic array is implemented using a static array. The static array is implemented using a pointer. The pointer is implemented using a bit. The bit is implemented using a transistor. The transistor is implemented using a semiconductor. The semiconductor is implemented using a crystal. The crystal is implemented using a rock. The rock is implemented using a planet. The planet is implemented using a star. The star is implemented using a galaxy. The galaxy is implemented using a universe. The universe is implemented using a multiverse. The multiverse is implemented using a metaverse. The metaverse is implemented using a megaverse. The megaverse is implemented using a hyperverse. The hyperverse is implemented using a hypervoid. The hypervoid is implemented using a
